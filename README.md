## About Finnhub Stock API

To acquire a realtime feeling to the application I have used [Finhub](https://finnhub.io/) API. It has [Websocket](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/websocket-trades) and some other relevant endpoints. Most of the endpoints are free to use. Bellow purposes I have used REST APIS available.

- To get [quote](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/quote)
- To get [company details](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/company-profile)
- To get [Metric Related Data](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/sector-metrics)
